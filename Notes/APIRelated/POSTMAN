POSTMAN
is a RESTAPI client tool that helps to test REST API urls
It is popular for both developers and testers
We can use both manual and automation purposes

---Client(Postman) ---> get request ---> SERVER(SPARTAN API) --->Spartan DB
                  <----Json Response <----

   HTTP status Codes
   200-> OK
   400->Clients Error
   500->Server Api's Error

   First Test Case
   When I send a GET request to Spartan
-I check status code
-I check Our body when I get response
