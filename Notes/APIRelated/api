What is API?
API is small piece of code that enables different applications and services to communicate and share information
with each other
Api is also called Web Service
skyscanner --->request--->   United's API ---> United database

-There are 2 types of API
1.SOAP
2.REST

SOAP:
-Soap is for communication between applications
-Soap is format for sending messages
-Soap communicates via internet
-Soap is platform independent
-Soap is based on XML(Communication is based on XML format)
REST:
-Rest is a lightweight option for developing web services using the HTTP protocol
It can structure data into XML or any other machine readable format , but usually JSON

SOAP vs REST:
-Soap is not popular anymore
-80% of the market is using REST
-Soap is xml Response, Rest is XML and json
-Rest is purely http protocol
-Soap is more complicated



Api testing requires an application to interact with API. In order to test an API, you will need to
1. Use testing tool to drive the API
2. Write your own codes to test the API
Why API testing is important ?
1. Faster to test than GUI testing
2. Without a UI, It can be tested earlier in the life cycle
3. Becoming more popular in the industry
4.Time efficiency vs functional and validation testing
5.Cost effective/Reduce testing Cost
