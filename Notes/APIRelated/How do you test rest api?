HOW DO YOU TEST REST API?

***I verify if each Rest API  end point is working as expected
***I send POST, PUT, GET, DELETE type of request and verify response status code and response body, header

***I also do positive and negative testing of API.
***When I do positive testing, I send valid request parameters, valid headers, valid request json body and verify
that response status code is 200 successful and Json response body data is also matching the expected.

*** When I do negative testing, I send invalid request parameters, or invalid headers, or invalid request json body
and verify that response status code is not 200 and Json response body contains error message
