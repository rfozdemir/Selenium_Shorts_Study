POM:
-This pattern helps enhance the tests by making them highly maintainable, reducing the code duplication
and hiding data the inner implementation from tests
-By using it we can make robust tests scripts and reduce code duplication.
-To implement the POM model in tests, we need to create a Page object class for each page that is being tested.
-The test need not worry about how input controls are used for the login page, their location details,
and so on.
-Login Tests will instantiate the login page object and call the login method by passing the username and password.
