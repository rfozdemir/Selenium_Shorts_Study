-HTML frames allow developers to present documents in multiple views, which may be in a separate child window
 or sub-window
 -Developers can embed external documents or documents from another domain using the <iframe> tag,also known as
 frames. Various social media web sites provide buttons that can be embedded in your web applications
 to link to these websites.
 -There is another HTML document inside a frame tag and you can find web elements from there
 -Advertisement banner are usually being frame. And you have to handle it. If you are going to text in  iframe
 you have let selenium know Because Selenium can't realize there is a frame if you don't tell. And it will throw an
exception. So You have to handle by using "switchTo().frame("location")" or "switchTo().defaultContent();"
