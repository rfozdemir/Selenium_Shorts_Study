By ID:
-It is most efficient and preferred way to locate an element. Because it is always must be unique every element.


By TagName:
-For example "<h1>practice</h1>" here "h1" is the tag name if you locate By tag name you can get text or some
useful thing from that element. getText() wil give you " practice"


By Name:
- name is attribute

By className:
-"class" in this case refers to the attribute on the DOM element. Often in practical use there are many DOM elements
with the same class name, thus finding multiple elements becomes the more practical option over finding the first
element.
<div class="cheese"> <span>Cheddar </span>   </div>
<div class="cheese"> <span>Gouda </span> </div>
--->  List <WebElement> cheeses =driver.findElements(By.className("cheese"));


By LinkText:
-find the link element with matching visible text.
Example of how to find an element that looks like this:
<a href="http//:www.google.com/search?q=cheese">cheese</a>
--above expression your text is "cheese". so linkedText means cheese don't forget then you can click by using
your text

By Partial Link Text:
Find the link element with partial matching visible text.



By Xpath:
----Relative and Absolute
--Absolute: is longer one, you are starting from root to last
--Relative:
-always start with "//" 2 front slashes
-tagname of element
-@-select attribute
-attribute - Attribute name of the element
-value -value of the attribute
-and "//tagname[@attribute='value'];" ----> DON'T FORGET this structure
Example:
<input type="text" name="example">  </input>
"//input[@name="example"]"----> This is our Xpath
Example:
"//a[.='Context Value']"
Example:
""//label[text()='Yellow']/preceding-sibling::input"


By CSS Selector:
Css is language that describes the style of HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
one of powerful method
-It is faster than Xpath so it is more preferable
<div id="food>
<span class="dairy">milk</span>
<span class="dairy aged">cheese</span>
</div>
-most important format is "span[class='dairy aged']"   --->>DON'T FORGET THIS FORMAT
- another format is "#food span.dairy.aged"
