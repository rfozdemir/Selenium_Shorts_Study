Why Synchronize?
-No such Element exception
-Code runs faster than browser can handle
-Element appears on the HTML after certain time
-Element is in the HTML but appears on the page after certain time

What can I do?
===Thread.sleep(do not use this)
===Implicit wait
===Explicit wait

Thread.Sleep
The method that pauses the execution of the Java program
Not considered a good practice
Too much use will make test long and heavy


Implicit Wait
-driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait()
-default is 0
-makes driver continue polling the DOM for the duration specified
-Stops polling as soon as the element is found
-will throw exception after the time expires if element not found
-will apply until the end of WebDriver instance or changed again

Explicit Wait
-can be used to wait for certain condition
-wait until element is visible
-wait until element is available
-wait until element is clickable
-wait until element is not available

=====WebDriverWait wait= new WebDriverWait(driver,10);
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath());
-will wait 10 seconds using the locator provided
-Does not depend on the value of implicit wait
-Only applies once when that line called
-will continue waiting if the elements is loaded but not clickable
