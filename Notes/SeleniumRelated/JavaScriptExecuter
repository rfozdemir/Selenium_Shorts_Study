Selenium WebDriver API provides the ability to execute Java Script code with the browser window. this is a very
useful feature when tests need to interact with the page using  java script.
-Using this Api, client side JS code can also be tested using Selenium WebDriver.
-By casting the WebDriver instance to a JavaScriptExecutor interface, we can execute js code in selenium WebDriver:


  JavaScriptExecutor js=(JavaScriptExecutor) driver;

  String Title=(String) js.executeScript("return document.title")
